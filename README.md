- Primitive data type in java are: int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean and char.
- They stored directly on the stack memory.

	-	int: take 16 bits in memory, the range possible value is `-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647`, represents whole numbers without any fractional part. Examples include int in languages like C, Java, and Python. the default value is 0.
	-	byte: similar to `int` the range possible value is `-128 to 127` but he take just 8 bits or 1 byte. the default value is 0.
	-	short: take 16 bits in memory, the range possible value is `-32,768 to 32,767`, the default value is 0.
	-	long: take 46 bits in memory, the range possible value is `-32,768 to 32,767`, the default value is 0.
	-	float: take 32 bits in the memory, represents numbers with fractional parts. Examples include float and double in languages like C, Java, and Python. the default value is 0.
	-	boolean: take 1 bits in the memory, represents the `true or false`, `0/1`, default value is false.
	-	char: take 16 bits in the memory, the range possible value is `0 to 65,535`, represents the unicode-encoded characters, the default value is `\u0000` or `null`.
